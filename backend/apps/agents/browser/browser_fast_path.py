"""
Browser fast path: skip the orchestrator for plainly browser-only requests.

The orchestrator LLM is ~2/3 of the token bill on a single-browser task and
adds two model turns of latency, all to decide "delegate this to a browser
agent" and then restate the agent's own outcome. When the request is clearly
just browsing, dispatch the browser sub-agent directly and let its OUTCOME
line be the reply.

Three gates, all conservative; any miss falls through to the orchestrator:
1. eligibility: first message of an agent session on a dashboard, no
   attachments/images/skills/forced tools (those need the orchestrator).
2. a zero-cost wordlist prefilter, so non-browsy chats never pay the
   classifier's latency.
3. a cheap-tier aux YES/NO classifier (provider-agnostic, timeboxed); only
   an unambiguous YES takes the fast path.
